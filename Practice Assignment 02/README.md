# Web Scraping using R and Python

## Overview
A “README.md” file with a short markdown description of this assignment 
A folder called “r_csv” with a R code for scraping the CSV example on cars in the Wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commaseparated_values] and saving the resulting output in the local folder (in CSV)
A folder called “python_csv” with a Python version of the code in point 2

## Note
Use the packages rvest (R) and BeautifulSoup (Python) for scraping operations. RSelenium (R) and Selenium (Python) can also be used, but they are generally more complicated to setup.
